                                <b>Snapshots of your to list items</b> 
                                <p>
                                    Snap, Post & Sell!  Take your own photos and if you've got to use a stock picture from a website or someone else's profile, be sure to give due credit. We ask of you to respect the copyright of others. Also, do ensure that your items are listed in the correct categories as well. 
                                </p>
                                
                                <b>Do moderate your listings</b>
                                <p>List products that are safe and appropriate for people of all ages. So no content unsuitable for minors.</p>
                                   
                                <b>Be Friendly and Respectful </b>
                                <p>Interact with fellow users as though they’re your friends and neighbours. Everyone has their own style, taste and creativity expressed in their listings, so we hope you can respect that. Be polite when you inquire on listings and do check out the listings' description before inquiring. That way, we can have a happy environment where everyone feels like home. Be patient, be nice! </p>

                                <b>Be Genuine & Sincere </b>
                                <p>Engage with fellow users as your true self. Please refrain from spamming and self-promotion as it affects your own credibility and reputation. </p>

                                <b>Create trustworthy listings</b>
                                <p>When creating a listing for your item, please be as accurate and honest in describing your item. Showcase and highlight anything that may concern a buyer (defects, color that has run etc) in your description. Buyers will only appreciate pleasant surprises and will react adversely if otherwise. Do be honest and upfront before going through with a deal. </p>

                                <b>Make the effort   </b>
                                <p>Ensure good lighting, clean background, nicely positioned items and so on! Even better, make the effort to enhance your photos with the built-in photo editor or with one of the many photo-taking apps available. Be creative! Poorly taken pictures so rarely attract buyers. Most importantly, snap a clear shot and just make sure you include an unfiltered, real image in one of the 10 available slots pictures as well. </p>

                                <b>Be a responsible seller & buyer </b>
                                <p>Be responsible for your actions. Treat others as you would like to be treated. As a seller, do make sure that your listings are true to picture, be honest about defects and sizing, and mail the items to your buyers, once they've made the monetary transaction. As a buyer, pay up on time, let the seller know if you're passing on the deal, and purchase smart. Utilize the Chat function well and make sure you're satisfied with the details provided before making a purchase. Scammers will not be tolerated and we'll be taking action against them, including assisting in the reporting of fraudsters to the police. So be honest and responsible in our Viroapp community. </p>

                                <b>Deal fairly </b>
                                <p>We know Viroapp is where users come to snag a great deal. To maintain good relations with the community, we hope that you would be mindful of the asking price of the seller when you are making an offer. No one likes to be offered an amount very much lower than the price listed. If you would like to negotiate for a better price, check with the seller if he/she is open to negotiate. </p> 

                                <b>Build up a good reputation </b>
                                <p>We want you to succeed as a buyer and/or seller on Viroapp. To show others in the community your credibility, always make sure to get your buyers/ sellers to leave you a feedback. Do keep in mind that feedbacks should be factual and relating to the transaction experience with the user on Viroapp. However, if you are found to be leaving fake feedback, your account will be suspended.</p> 

                                <b>Choose an appropriate username </b>

                                <b>Do not keyword spam </b>
                                <p>Please do not add irrelevant tags to the Description tab as it affects the user’s browsing experience.

                                <b>Do not list items that are prohibited or of mature content</b>

                                <b>Do not spam! </b>
                                <p>No one really likes looking at 5 listings of the same product all at once.

                                <b>Do not use the platform for promotions</b>

                                <b>Some other things to note: </b>
                                <p>*Doing COD? Check, check and check again before you hand over your cash. Be sure you know exactly what you're in for when you make a purchase. Buying online / second hand entails some risks, so always mitigate them by negotiating for personalized warranties and basically covering all the ground when discussing about the item with the seller. Ask for mailing proof, transaction references, real-life images of your items and then make sure that you're satisfied with all details before confirming the deal. If alarm bells ring, think twice and ensure that you've got sufficient evidence should there be a need to refer matters to the authorities.<br> 
                                    *Be safe when meeting up. Always arrange to meet in a public place where you and the buyer / seller will not be alone. Examples of such places include MRT stations or shopping malls etc.. Be cautious! <br>
                                    * Our sellers reserve the rights to authorize a transaction at their discretion, but please, be a responsible one. <br>
                                    * We have built in many features into the platform and hope that they will be useful when you are using Viroapp. We seek your cooperation not to abuse these features. Some examples of abuse (non-exhaustive) would include competitive flagging or mass flagging of listings, spamming users via the chat feature. Users found abusing features would have their rights restricted or accounts suspended without further notice. <br>
                                    - We do not have a seller refund policy and matters pertaining to bad purchases are unfortunately out of our control; however, please reach out to us and we will take action ASAP. This may include removing listings or even banning users who have been found to flout our guidelines. <br>
                                    - T&Cs of individual users/ shops are not supported by Viroapp. We cannot and will not enforce these additional shop rules on your behalf. <br>
                                
                                    * You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account on your profile to blacklist them, however, that might not be the best way to solve this problem. We do not encourage singling out users like this on Viroapp as it could be seen as harassment and thus violates our guidelines. Please help us flag blacklistings if you see them and we’ll remove them asap.<br> 
                                    * Please do not promote your items by commenting on other people's item listings! Just imagine if you owned a shop, would you want someone walking in to your shop and driving customers to their own? <br>
                                    * Our admins in Viroapp have the right to change any of the guidelines or make any decision pertaining to the suspension and / or removal of product listings or user accounts. <br>
                                    * If you believe that there's an immediate cause for concern, please contact the Viroapp team with as much information you can provide (username, descriptions etc) - so that we can quickly intervening respond to a situation that requires our attention. <br>

                                    Any listings or users are in breach of these guidelines, the Viroapp team reserves the right to take necessary action. In some cases, it'd mean de-listing your items, or we would even have to ban you as a user. We'd hate to do that so please stick with the "rules". <br>
